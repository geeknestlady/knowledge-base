# Retro for 06/10/2018 Meetup

## Good
* Great turnout, RSVP helps us know how much space we need
* Meeting started when it felt "right"

## Bad
* Too early
* Having to be let in
* Inconsistent voting

## What can we do differently?
* Schedule at 2pm instead?
* Book the Showroom (or other suggestions?)
* Would people like meeting notes? Be comfortable with anonymously sharing takeaways?
* Clearer voting
* How to get the word out? We have a lot of communities that need mentorship.
* How can we find more mentors & show value for them too?
